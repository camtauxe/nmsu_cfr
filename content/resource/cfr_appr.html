  This page allows you to view the courses submitted by each department. To approve courses, press the 'Approve Courses'
  button to bring up a table of all of the that department's still-unapproved courses. Here, you can change the
  course's cost, select a commitment code, and check the checkbox to approve a course. Press 'Submit Approvals'
  when done.

<p class="noprint">
  You can also commit an amount of money to a department by editing the 'Dean Commitment' field in the table. Press
  'Submit Commitments' to submit these changes.
