"""
Functions to perform various operations and queries on the database.

These functions are considerd "low-level" and are meant to be used
as parts of a larger, atomic transaction. So they take a mySQL cursor
as an argument which they use to execute queries.

These functions are written assuming the cursor that is passed in is
the default kind. They may behave unpredictably if different kinds of
cursors are passed in.

TODO: There are some maintainability problems with how a lot of data
that this module deals with is represented. CFRs, Courses and Savings are
all represented as tuples and data is accessed with hard-coded indices.
There are a number of things that can be done to fix this, such as creating
classes or some heavy use of type-hinting. As is, making changes to the
way data is represented (for example adding a field to REQ_FIELDS) can break
things in a lot of places because the rest of the code isn't designed to deal
with it very dynamically.
